# GoFun: Fun λ with Go 

Doing what Go's creators did not want us to do: \
Functional programming in Go!

## Why, though? 🤔

Just goofing (or goofin', goofun', gofun! Get it?!) around, hehehe :P

It's a bit like meditation, because uni beat these concepts so deep into my skull. 💀

## Should I use this in my project? 

I have not tried importing this into a project. Does it even work? 🤔

Also, there is no release. 😱

Also, there is very little going on in here.
I guess you could copy the bits you need into your project, you weirdo... 

On that matter: Why not just use go as intended or implement these functions on your own?
Millions of computer science students were forced to implement these basics, you can do it as well!

This is under heavy construction 🚧 or barely tested to work, I haven't decided yet.
Maybe both?

**Conclusion:** Have you lost your mind!? **_No!_** ⛔️
